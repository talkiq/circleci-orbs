### Standard Checklist
<!---
Have you ensured your comments/docstrings/type hints are clear? For example,
are you using ``typing.Any`` and need to clarify? Are you using a ``str`` when
an ``enum.Enum`` would fit better? Would it be clear to clients what to pass
in, return from, and catch when working with your methods?
--->
- [ ] My comments/docstrings/type hints are clear
<!---
Have you written tests? Unit vs generative vs integration vs e2e as need be!

Consider: does this change require testing on staging, or do the automated
tests capture 100% of all issues?

<!---
Have you manually tested? Run locally, smoke test on staging, etc!

Is there a non-default rollback strategy we'd need to consider (eg. is ``git
revert`` enough or would we need to, say, also flush a task queue)?

<!---
Are there any new metrics/monitors/alerts we need to add? How does this affect
our SLO tracking?
--->
